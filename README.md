# Automated-Twitter-Interaction-Script
This code is a script that automates various social media interactions such as liking tweets, retweeting tweets, posting tweets, and following users. It takes two arguments as inputs: a query string and a count of how many tweets/users to interact with. The interactions are performed in a loop, with a sleep interval of 1 hour, and continue indefinitely until manually stopped. The code allows for customizing the types of interactions you want to automate, but it should be used responsibly as excessive automation can result in your account being flagged or banned by the social media platform.

To use the code above, you will need to do the following steps:

- 1.) Install the required libraries: The code uses the tweepy library for accessing the Twitter API, so you will need to install it by running the following command in your terminal/command prompt:
Copy code
pip install tweepy

- 2.) Create a Twitter Developer Account: To use the Twitter API, you need to create a Twitter developer account and obtain API credentials (consumer key, consumer secret, access token, and access secret). You can do this by visiting the Twitter Developer website and following the instructions there.

- 3.) Replace the placeholder values in the code: Replace the placeholder values for the API credentials in the code with the actual values you obtained in step 2. You will also need to replace the query string and count with your desired values.

- 4.) Run the code: You can run the code by executing it in your Python environment or by running it from the terminal/command prompt by using the following command:

Copy code
python filename.py
Where filename.py is the name of the file that contains the code.

Once the code is running, it will perform the automated social media interactions according to the defined parameters (query string and count). Note that excessive automation can result in your account being flagged or banned by the social media platform, so be sure to use it responsibly.
